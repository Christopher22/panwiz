*panwiz* is a template to utilize a Github action for converting between various formats using @macfarlane2006. Its primary usage is the compilation of pretty scientific papers from Markdown files. The [corresponding configuration file](pandoc.default.yml) defines the command-line arguments for the executable in the background.

Your workflow may look like this:
- Fork or copy this project
- Specify your input and output files, which defaults to this README and a pretty PDF generated by LaTeX. However, many other formats are supported.
- (Add further gimmicks: This can be bibliographies, templates, other properties, and metadata - be creative! Pandoc is extremely powerful.)
- Write your text and commit as much as you want.
- Push your changes to GitHub. The conversion process will start.
- Once the process is done, you will see a red cross or a green checkmark on the right of your last commit's description
  - In the former case, an error occurred. Check for errors under "Run pandoc"
  - In the latter case, you can download under "Artifacts" the output.zip containing all the files you saved there.
- (Repeat committing and pushing.)

If you are unsure, just download the PDF generated by this project and have a look!

All the best for your thesis or paper!
